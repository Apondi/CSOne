        <h1>Module: Programming 1</h1> 
          <p>In this module, we will learn how to program/code. programming is the process of creating a set of instructions that tell a computer how to perform a task. Programming can be done using a variety of computer "languages," such as SQL, Java, Python, and C++.</p>

<h2 class="heading">What is Programming?</h2>
<div class="content">
    <p>Computers aren't very smart. Sure, they can do a lot of math or help you search the Internet. But, if you asked a computer to vacuum the house for you, could it do it? If you asked a computer to draw a picture of a bird for you, would it? A computer would have no idea about what you're saying. This makes it necessary for us to provide instructions to the computer. This is done through coding. Source: <a href="http://www.programmingbasics.org/en/beginner/commands.html">programmingbasics.org</a></p>

    <p>asically, writing software (computer programs) involves describing processes, procedures; it involves the authoring of algorithms.  Computer programming involves developing lists of instructions - the source code representation of software  The stuff that these instructions manipulate are different types of objects, e.g., numbers, words, images, sounds, etc...  Creating a computer program can be like composing music, like designing a house, like creating lots of stuff.  It has been argued that in its current state it is an art, not engineering.</p>
    <p>An important reason to consider learning about how to program a computer is that the concepts underlying this will be valuable to you, regardless of whether or not you go on to make a career out of it.  One thing that you will learn quickly is that a computer is very dumb, but obedient.  It does exactly what you tell it to do, which is not necessarily what you wanted.  Programming will help you learn the importance of clarity of expression.</p>
