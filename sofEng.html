<h2 class="heading">What is Sofware Engineering?</h2>
<div class="content">
    <p>Software engineering (SE) is the application of engineering to the development of software in a systematic method</p>
    <p>Software Engineering is useful because there is always a gap between software and hardware as far as innovation is concerned. In general, software progress is slower than hardware. Among the reasons software progress is slower than hardware include:<br/>- Computer hardware progress is so fast and not that the software progress is so slow.<br/>- Computer software development has a couple of difficulties that make it inefficient. These include: essence,the difficulties inherent in the nature of software, and accidents, those difficulties that today attend its production but are not inherent. <br/>It is true to say that the complexity of a software is an essential property, not an accidental one. Hence, descriptions of a software entity that abstract away its complexity often abstract away its essence.  For three centuries, mathematics and the physical sciences made great strides by constructing simplified models of complex phenomena, deriving properties from the models, and verifying those properties by experiment. This paradigm worked because the complexities ignored in the models were not the essential properties of the phenomena. It does not work when the complexities are the essence.</p>

    <p>The inherent properties of the irreducible essence of modern software systems is complexity.From complexity comes the difficulties of communication among members, hence product flows, cost overruns, schedule delays. Complexity also leads to difficulties of understanding all the possible states of the program hence unreliability. Complexity also causes the difficulty of invoking functions, which makes products hard to use.</p>
